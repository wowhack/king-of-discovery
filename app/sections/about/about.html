    <h1>King of Discovery</h1>
    <p>King of Discovery is an app created for the 2014 wow hack.</p>
    <p>The app provides users a fun and interactive way of discovering new music while meeting people with the same music taste</p>
    <p>The users can join 'hills', which are group rooms in which they can chat and present music to each other. The twist is that only one person at a time gets to decide which songs the rest of the hill listents to, as if he were the king of the hill. While the users listen to those songs, they can export them to other serices in case they like them (that's the main purpose of the website, to discover new music). But, at the same time, they get a riddle based on the song preview they are listening to. The fastest and most correct user in the room will be the next king of the hill and will choose three songs for the rest of the people to hear</p>
